# Stochastic_BB
Python implementation of SVRG-BB and SGD-BB algorithms of the following paper:

["Barzilai-Borwein Step Size for Stochastic Gradient Descent". Conghui Tan, Shiqian Ma, Yu-Hong Dai, Yuqiu Qian. _NIPS 2016_.]()


## Sources

- stochastic_bb.py: the source code for SVRG-BB and SGD-BB algorithms
- example.py: an example showing how to use these two algorithms


## Requirements

The code can be run with either Python 2 or Python 3, with numpy package installed.

But to run the example, scipy and theano are also needed.
